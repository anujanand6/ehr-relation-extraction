# NER and Relation Extraction from EHR

An Electronic Health Record (EHR) [[1]](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/E-Health/EHealthRecords) is an electronic version of a patient's medical history that includes extremely important information including, but not limited to, problems, medication, progress notes, immunizations and laboratory reports. EHRs are huge free-text data files that are documented by healthcare professionals, like clinical notes, discharge summaries or lab reports. Finding information from this data is time consuming, since the data is unstructured and there may be multiple such records for a single patient. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques could be used to make this data structured, and quickly find information whenever needed, thereby saving healthcare professionals' time from these mundane tasks.

In this project, we aim to build a tool that would automatically structure this data into a format that would enable doctors and patients to quickly find information that they need. Specifically, we aim to build a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that would recognize entities such as drug, strength, duration, frequency, adverse drug event (ADE) [[2]](https://www.cdc.gov/medicationsafety/adult_adversedrugevents.html), reason for taking the drug, route and form. Further, the model would also recognize the relationship between drug and every other named entity as well. This would allow healthcare professionals to not only look at individual entities, but also all the relationships between them. This would also allow the doctors to easily find out the relationships between a drug and ADEs so that such drugs can be monitored carefully. \par

The final goal of this project is to build an API where healthcare professionals and patients could send EHR data and the API would return character ranges for each annotation so they can be highlighted in the original data, a structured json-format data that includes separately labelled data for medication history and discharge medications. The highlighted annotations could be useful when a healthcare professional wants to see important information along with other details in the EHR. The structured information can be used to store the data for quick reference in the future. Because the EHR contains medication history as well as discharge medications, labelling them as such could help in merging new information, as the medication history would remain the same.
